An attempt at piglatin using D

Piglatin: A coding for regular english words, where 
            - if the words start with a vowel, the piglatin string would require addition of "yay" at the end
            - if it starts with consonent, remove the string of consonents in the beginning till the first vowel
                 and attach it at the end of the word, followed by "ay"
